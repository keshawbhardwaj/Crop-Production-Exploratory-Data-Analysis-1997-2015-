# Crop-Production-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(1997-2015)
Project Description: The Crop Production Exploratory Data Analysis project aims to analyze the crop production data from the years 1997 to 2015. The project begins by downloading the datasets in CSV format from data.gov.in and then loading them into an MS SQL Server database.

Once the data is loaded, SQL queries are used to extract the required data for analysis. The extracted data is then connected to Power BI Desktop using a database connection.

In Power BI Desktop, a report is created with insightful visualizations. The first visualization is a gauge that displays the total production over all the years. This provides an overview of the overall crop production.

Next, an area chart is used to show the growth in production over the years. This visualization helps identify trends and patterns in crop production.

Another area graph is created to display the top crop production areas. This visualization allows for a comparison of crop production across different regions.

A pie chart is used to showcase the maximum production by season, specifically kharif and Rabi. This visualization provides insights into the distribution of crop production during different seasons.

A clustered column chart is created to analyze the growth in crop production for specific crops during kharif and Rabi seasons. This visualization helps identify which crops have shown significant growth over the years.

Finally, a funnel chart is used to display the maximum production by state. This visualization allows for a comparison of crop production across different states.

Overall, this project aims to provide valuable insights into crop production trends and patterns based on the 1997-2015 data. By utilizing SQL queries and Power BI visualizations, it enables users to easily understand and analyze the crop production data.
